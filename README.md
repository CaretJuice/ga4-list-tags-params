# List GA4 Tags and Parameters
This Colab Notebook parses the Google Tag Manager JSON container export for GA4 tags, event parameters, and user properties and then saves them to a Google Sheet in a matrix format.

To use this notebook, you will need to manually export the desired container from GTM, select **Runtime** > **Run all**, open the **Choose Files** dialog when the first cell has run, upload your JSON file, and then finally log in to Google Drive when prompted.

A file will be saved to your Drive with the name *GTM GA4 Tags for container_id*.

Detailed documentation is inline in the notebook.
